## ZephyrSim

**ZephyrSim** is an open-source drone simulation environment built in **IsaacSim** and **OpenUSD**. It focuses on realistic aerial navigation through dynamic environments with wind, planes, and GPS imperfections‚Äîideal for testing autonomous flight logic and perception systems.

---

## Features

- Realistic drone flight with simulated GPS & IMU
- Configurable wind zones and turbulence fields
- Simulated airspace with moving planes
- Path-planning with Python scripting
- Sensor support: Coming soon!
- ROS2-ready (optional) for real-world testing integration

## Wind Physics Models

### Vertical Wind Profile (Logarithmic Law)
The mean wind speed at height $z$ is:

$$
v(z) = v_{ref} \frac{\ln(z/z_0)}{\ln(z_{ref}/z_0)}
$$

- $z_0$: surface roughness (m)
- $v_{ref}$: wind speed at reference height $z_{ref}$
- $z$: current height (m)

This models how wind increases with altitude above the ground.

---

### Dryden Turbulence Model
A standard model for simulating atmospheric turbulence in flight simulation:

- Generates realistic, time-correlated wind fluctuations in all directions.
- Used in aerospace and UAV research.
- See: [Dryden Wind Turbulence Model (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryden_wind_turbulence_model)

---

### Gust Fronts and Microbursts
- **Gust Front:** Sudden, strong, short-lived increase in wind speed, often in the main wind direction.
- **Microburst:** Localized, intense downdraft with outward radial wind at the surface.

Both are modeled as time- and position-dependent wind events:
- Gusts: $\vec{v}_{gust} = \vec{v}_{wind} \cdot S(t, d)$
- Microburst: $\vec{v}_{microburst} = [\text{outflow}, \text{down}, \text{outflow}]$

where $S(t, d)$ is a shape function of time and distance from the event center.
