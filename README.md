## ZephyrSim

**ZephyrSim** is an open-source drone simulation environment built in **IsaacSim** and **OpenUSD**. It focuses on realistic aerial navigation through dynamic environments with wind, planes, and GPS imperfections‚Äîideal for testing autonomous flight logic and perception systems.

---

## Features

- Realistic drone flight with simulated GPS & IMU
- Configurable wind zones and turbulence fields
- Simulated airspace with moving planes
- Path-planning with Python scripting
- Sensor support: Coming soon!
- ROS2-ready (optional) for real-world testing integration

## Wind Physics Models

### Vertical Wind Profile (Logarithmic Law)
The mean wind speed at height $z$ is:

$$
v(z) = v_{ref} \frac{\ln(z/z_0)}{\ln(z_{ref}/z_0)}
$$

- $z_0$: surface roughness (m)
- $v_{ref}$: wind speed at reference height $z_{ref}$
- $z$: current height (m)

This models how wind increases with altitude above the ground.

---

### Dryden Turbulence Model
A standard model for simulating atmospheric turbulence in flight simulation:

- Generates realistic, time-correlated wind fluctuations in all directions.
- Used in aerospace and UAV research.
- See: [Dryden Wind Turbulence Model (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryden_wind_turbulence_model)

---

### Gust Fronts and Microbursts
- **Gust Front:** Sudden, strong, short-lived increase in wind speed, often in the main wind direction.
- **Microburst:** Localized, intense downdraft with outward radial wind at the surface.

Both are modeled as time- and position-dependent wind events:
- Gusts: $\vec{v}_{gust} = \vec{v}_{wind} \cdot S(t, d)$
- Microburst: $\vec{v}_{microburst} = [\text{outflow}, \text{down}, \text{outflow}]$

where $S(t, d)$ is a shape function of time and distance from the event center.

### Air Density and Altitude Simulation
ZephyrSim models air density variations with altitude using the barometric formula, which is critical for realistic drag and wind force calculations. The air density $\rho$ (kg/m¬≥) at altitude $h$ (meters) is calculated as:

$$
\rho(h) = \rho_0 \left( \frac{T_0 - L \cdot h}{T_0} \right)^{\frac{g \cdot M}{R \cdot L} - 1}
$$

Where:
- $\rho_0 = 1.225$ kg/m¬≥ (sea-level air density)
- $T_0 = 288.15$ K (sea-level temperature, 15¬∞C)
- $L = 0.0065$ K/m (temperature lapse rate)
- $g = 9.80665$ m/s¬≤ (gravitational acceleration)
- $M = 0.0289644$ kg/mol (molar mass of air)
- $R = 8.31447$ J/(mol¬∑K) (gas constant)
- $h$: altitude (m, clamped to $\geq 0$)

This model approximates air density changes up to approximately 11 km, accounting for temperature decrease with altitude. The calculated air density is used in drag force computations:

$$
\vec{F}_{drag} = -0.5 \cdot \rho(h) \cdot C_d \cdot A \cdot |\vec{v}_{rel}| \cdot \vec{v}_{rel}
$$

Where:
- $C_d = 0.3$ (drag coefficient)
- $A = 0.1$ m¬≤ (cross-sectional area)
- $\vec{v}_{rel}$: relative velocity between drone and wind

This ensures realistic simulation of wind effects on the drone at varying altitudes.
